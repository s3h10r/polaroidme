polaroidme is a simple to use command-line-tool for placing an image into a
Polaroid-like frame and optionally put a title / description on the bottom.
The default font mimics scribbled handwriting but any (ttf-)font
which suits your taste is supported. polaroidme offers basic features
like auto-scaling up-/downwards and/or cropping, using any (ttf-)font,
supports high-res output and gets the job just done well.
It is intended & mainly used as a command-line-tool but can also be used as
a python-module (means: it exports its core-function).

polaroidme is actively maintained & developed (2019).
To see if it fits your needs take a look at the project's
github-repo and check out the `examples`_

Contributions are welcome, and they are greatly appreciated!
